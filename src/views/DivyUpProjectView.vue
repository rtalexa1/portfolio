      This was the first full stack application that I made on my own. I was
      inspired by group trips with friends. Math has never been my forte, and I
      wanted to make something that would make settling up easier. Users can
      enter receipts, which are added to a group's total. When the group is
      ready to divy up, the app can calculate how much money each group member
      owes or is owed.

      I chose Rails for this project because it was the only framework I had
      learned at the time. That said, I really enjoy the intuitiveness of Ruby,
      and all of Rails conventions make it a great tool with which to
      experiment.

      From a technical standpoint, my top goal with this project was to get my
      feet wet with the basics of HTML and CSS. I learned a lot from this
      project just by trial-and-error, and although I went in a little
      trepidatious, I discovered that I enjoy frontend work a lot more than I
      thought I would.
