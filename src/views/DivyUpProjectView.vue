        This was the first full stack application that I made on my own. I was
        inspired by group trips with friends. Math has never been my forte, and
        I wanted to make something that would make settling up easier. Users can
        enter receipts, which are added to a group's total. When the group is
        ready to divy up, the app can calculate how much money each group member
        owes or is owed.

        I chose Rails for this project because it was the only framework I had
        learned at the time. That said, I really enjoy the intuitiveness of
        Ruby, and all of Rails conventions make it a great tool with which to
        experiment.

        From a technical standpoint, my top goal with this project was to get my
        feet wet with the basics of HTML and CSS. I learned a lot from this
        project just by trial-and-error, and although I went in a little
        trepidatious, I discovered that I enjoy frontend work a lot more than I
        thought I would.
