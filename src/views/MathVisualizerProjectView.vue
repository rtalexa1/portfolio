      As a teacher, I saw my fifth graders struggle with long division. Although
      each step of the process is relatively simple, I think the sheer magnitude
      of the problems overwhelmed students. I created this app to help students
      see that division is not so bad when broken up into smaller steps.

      I once again chose Vue for this project because I enjoy using the
      framework, and I wanted to get some more practice with it. This project
      highlighted what has been a consistent theme throughout my time
      programming: nothing is as simple as it seems. What was a very simple
      project in my head turned out to be rather complex and required me to use
      JavaScript in ways that I had not used it up to that point. My eagerness
      to dive right into new projects can come back to haunt me when I encounter
      an obstacle that I probably could have foreseen with a little more
      planning.
